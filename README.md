# BLB-RF-Simulation

Simulations performed to asses the performance of the BLRF algorithm and the comparison against the standard Random Forest algorithm.

Simulation data sets are generated using Rstudio and the simulations are performed on a computer with 64 AMD Opteron 6276 CPUs running at 1.4 GHz.

Part of the results are shown in the Plot folder. For a complete (ongoing) comprehensive summary of the project, refer to Bag_of_Little_Random_Forests.pdf.
